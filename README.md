# Decadal-Analysis-On-Pollution
The motive of this project is twofold, Performing a Decadal analysis of air pollution in India for 2011-2020 and understanding the impact of the covid-19 on the pollution levels across the country. For this purpose, various methods are used at both state and city levels. Chi-square test, Z-score are used to find Outliers, Hotspots and coldspots of Cities and states. Various plots and heatmaps are used to understand the changing pollutant concentration levels in the country. Correlation between different pollutants with Number of industries, Number of motor vehicles and Population of the state is found. Later five-year average monthly trend for pollutants is plotted to understand the variation in their concentrations in different months. In the later part, the Impact of covid on pollution in different cities and states is analysed using both AQI values and pollutant levels before and after lockdown.
