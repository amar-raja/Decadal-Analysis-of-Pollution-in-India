For Simplicity, I have structured the content in the form of directories.
1)Raw: In this section, I have placed all the raw data (uncleaned) that I used to complete the Project.
2)Dataset: In this section, I have placed all the Data Files (Cleaned) used in the Project.
3)Jupyter Notebook: In this section, I have placed all the Jupyter Notebooks that I have used to solve this Project. 
4)Code: In this section, I have placed all the Codes that I have used to solve this Project. 
5)Generate Map: In this section, We have store the codes to generate Map for our Project.
5.1)Dataset: Here generated data and some predefined data are stored. They are necessary to run our maps.
5.2)Jupyter Notebook: Here you will find code to generate the map
6)Images: In this section, I have placed all the Scripts used to run a particular program and generate the outputs.
7)Html: Here you will find some generated HTML files which are the output of some files.
8)Scripts: Here you will find all the scripts that are important to run the Project.

For executing the whole Project, I have created a Script Filename “project.sh”.


In this Scripts Directory, this list of Scripts are as follows
1) generate-clean-data.sh
2) generate-chi-score.sh
3) generate-z-score.sh
4) generate-heatmaps.sh
5) generate-correlation.sh
6) generate-clustering.sh
7) generate-covid19.sh




To Run the main Script file in Linux Terminal:

>> sh project.sh


The following dependencies are used in my Project

1) Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
2) Python (v3.7.6)
3) Numpy 
4) Pandas
5) Scipy
6) Plotly
7) Folium


Every Code and Jupyter Notebook is properly commented for better understanding.
